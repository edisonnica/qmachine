QMachine
========


[QMachine](https://www.qmachine.org) (QM) is a web service for distributed
computing. Its design relaxes the usual requirements of a distributed computer
so far that it can be powered completely by web browsers â€“ without installing
anything. This repository is structured as a
[superproject](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Git/Submodules_and_Superprojects),
which means that cloning it requires cloning its submodules, too:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/qmachine/qmachine.git

As a model for computation, QM is described in a recent open access paper,
[QMachine: commodity supercomputing in web browsers](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/176).
That paper, which is the
[most highly accessed paper of all time](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/mostviewed/alltime)
for *BMC Bioinformatics*, explains some of the design decisions behind QM,
demonstrates its use in scientific workflows, and elaborates on some of its
future directions. The accompanying screencasts, one of which was featured by
the
[HPCwire](http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2013-03-14/qmachine_combines_hpc_with_www.html)
and
[insideHPC](http://insidehpc.com/2013/03/09/video-qmachine-commodity-supercomputing-with-web-browsers/)
news sites, are available on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwUGp_wSf5vjD5vwzj9Dhqbz-y54oALIe).
QM has also graced the front page of
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6095595).

The [manual](https://docs.qmachine.org) is improving steadily, and a
[project wiki](https://www.qmachine.org/wiki/Main_Page) is also available for
reference.
