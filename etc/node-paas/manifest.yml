#-  Cloud Foundry application manifest

#-  manifest.yml ~~
#
#   This file is used for deploying to Cloud Foundry platforms. This file has
#   only been tested with IBM Bluemix so far, and I wasn't using the `cf`
#   command-line tool because I was using IBM's Continuous Delivery Pipeline
#   instead.
