Browser client
==============

The browser client is the easiest place to start, because it can be added to
your own webpage with a single line of HTML:
::

<script src="https://www.qmachine.org/q.js"></script>


Upon loading, your webpage will contain the ``QM`` object in its JavaScript
environment, allowing your page's scripts to submit and volunteer to execute
compute jobs on your page's visitors' machines using QM's API server completely
for free.
