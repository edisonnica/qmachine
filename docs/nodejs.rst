Node.js
=======

Install with NPM
----------------

A Node.js_ module is available for installation with
`Node Package Manager`_ (NPM). To install it in the current directory,
::

$ npm install qm


API client
----------

A client for Node.js is planned, but it not yet available as part of the
module. When it becomes available, it will be possible to submit jobs from a
Node.js program to be executed by volunteer compute nodes.


API server
----------

The original, reference version of QM is available as part of the module, and
a basic web server is also provided to enable the use of web browsers as
compute nodes if so desired.


Try it live
~~~~~~~~~~~

Live, interactive demonstrations of the API and web servers are
available at runnable.com_. These will give you a different insight into the
guts of QM by allowing you to make your own copies to play with and debug,
completely for free.
