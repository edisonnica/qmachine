Source code
===========

There are a number of repositories associated with QMachine, and they are all
being transferred to the `QMachine organization`_ on GitHub.


Browser client
--------------

The source code for the :doc:`browser client <browser-client>` is available at
https://github.com/qmachine/qm-browser-client.


Main project
------------

The main project repository is the best place to start with development. It is
structured as a superproject_, which means that cloning it requires cloning
its submodules, too:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/qmachine/qmachine.git

There are also "mirrors" available at Bitbucket_, CodePlex_, GitLab_, and
SourceForge_. The repositories at Gitorious_ and `Google Code`_ will no longer
be updated because those hosting services are being shut down.


Node.js
-------

The source code for the :doc:`Node.js module <nodejs>` is available at
https://github.com/qmachine/qm-nodejs.


Python
------

The source code for a *very* incomplete Python package is available at
https://github.com/qmachine/qmachine-python.

The source code for an experimental R package is available at
https://github.com/qmachine/qm-r.
