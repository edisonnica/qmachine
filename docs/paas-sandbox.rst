Running on Platform-as-a-Service
================================

QMachine is easy to deploy using Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) because its
design was driven by the goal to be as far "above the metal" as possible.

Directions for platforms such as Bluemix_, Heroku_, and OpenShift_ are
forthcoming.
