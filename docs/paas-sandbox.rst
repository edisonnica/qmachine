Running on Platform-as-a-Service
================================

QMachine is easy to deploy using Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) because its
design was driven by the goal to be as far "above the metal" as possible.


One-click deployment to Heroku
------------------------------

In fact, QM is so far "above the metal" that it can be deployed to Heroku_
with a single click. Skeptical? Visit the version-controlled repository at
https://github.com/qmachine/qm-ruby-turnkey to try it out :-)


Other platforms
---------------

Full directions for platforms such as Bluemix_, Heroku, and OpenShift_ are
forthcoming.
