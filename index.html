<p><a href="https://www.qmachine.org">QMachine</a> (QM) is a web service that can incorporate
ordinary web browsers into a World Wide Computer without installing anything.
QM contains three main components: an API server, a web server, and a website.
The API server provides a message-passing interface between nodes using HTTP
and JSON, and the web server exists only to serve the website, which functions
as the browser client application. <a href="http://wilkinson.github.io/quanah/">Quanah</a>
is used extensively to manage concurrency issues.</p>

<p>Currently, there are two implementations of the server-side components. The
original version is written in <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and is available
for deployment to server environments via <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/qm">NPM</a>.
A &quot;teaching version&quot; written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> is also
available, and eventually it will be packaged and installable as a
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/qm">Gem</a>.</p>

<p>I am now revising the first of several manuscripts I have been preparing for
peer-reviewed academic journals. These reports will explain some of the design
decisions behind QM, demonstrate the use of QM in scientific workflows, and
elaborate on the future directions of QM. I published a few screencasts on
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLijUCyE0Z0-8nLL5qJ__v-VB3ZoRxSubg">YouTube</a>
recently, one of which has been featured on the
<a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/hpcwire/2013-03-14/qmachine_combines_hpc_with_www.html">HPCwire</a>
and
<a href="http://insidehpc.com/2013/03/09/video-qmachine-commodity-supercomputing-with-web-browsers/">insideHPC</a>
news sites. QM has also graced the front page of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6095595">Hacker News</a>.</p>

      Note that this page embeds QM's analytical layer, too, which means that
      you can open your browser's developer console and experiment without even
      leaving this page!
